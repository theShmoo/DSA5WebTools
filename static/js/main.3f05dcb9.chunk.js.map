Das Treffen des Humusballs ist in der Zauberdauer inbegriffen, der Magier muss also keine zusätzliche Aktion aufwenden. Der Humusball explodiert, wenn er sein Ziel oder auf ein großes, festes Hindernis trifft (z.B. eine Wand oder einen Schild). Verlässt der Humusball die Reichweite, ohne ein Ziel zu treffen, so löst er sich auf. Auch die Gefährten des Zauberers können von dem Humusball getroffen werden, wenn er explodiert. Der Radius der Explosion beträgt 5 Schritt. Der Schaden beträgt einen Schritt um das Zentrum der Explosion herum 2W6+(QS x 2) Trefferpunkte (auch gegen leblose Objekte als Strukturschaden). Pro Schritt Entfernung von diesem Bereich verringert sich der Schaden um 3 TP. Der Humusball trifft automatisch, wenn man ihm nicht aktiv zu entgehen versucht. Um dem Humusball zu entgehen, muss eine Verteidigung eingesetzt und eine Probe auf Körperbeherrschung (Kampfmanöver) abgelegt werden. Pro QS hat der Held sich 1 Schritt weit weg vom Zentrum der Explosion bewegt.* Trifft der Humusball sein Ziel, werden die TP durch den RS des Ziels vermindert. Alle getroffenen Ziele werden zudem bei 1-3 auf 1W6 von Ranken umschlungen und erhalten den Status Fixiert. Eine Zerstörung der Ranken ist nicht möglich, da sie sofort nachwachsen. Das Ziel vermag sich jedoch unter Aufwendung 1 Aktion und mittels einer gelungenen Probe auf Körperbeherrschung (Entwinden) zu befreien. Die Ranken verbleiben 5 KR, danach lösen sie sich komplett auf.<br><br>*Gegnern steht kein Passierschlag zu, da sie selbst zu überrascht sind.
